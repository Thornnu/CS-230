SNHU CS-230 Final

-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? For this class the client was this company called The Gaming Room. They had already built a game called Draw It or Lose It. The Gaming Room had asked me to give advice on how to improve their already game. What ways could I help them with cost, user options, servers, and how to create their game on multiple platforms. After many weeks of investigating ways to help The Gaming Room improve their overall functionality of their software, I neatly compiled a list to highlight certain the good and bad for server options, client based, operating systems, functionality, storage management, and also security features. 

-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Being able to work through the design document helped me to focus on certain tasks and helped me to better display the pros and cons for each topic that I needed to present to The Gaming Room for ways to improve their software. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my recommendation document. After I submitted my document and read over it again, I realized that I was not able to properly portray what I wanted to say in words as much as I wanted to.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The first thing that I did was listen to what the user was wanting. What their needs were and write those down so that I can prioritize their needs. By doing this I was able to organize a team and have multiple teams all working on separate projects at the same time and then all come together to complete the final project. It was very important to oversee these projects to ensure that they meet the concerns of the user in each and every project before we brought them together for the final cut. 

-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The way that I approached designing the software was in a very organized manner. I love making tables, charts, goals, and roads on how to accomplish all of the necessary that are needed first. The best tool that I used was File explore. Being able to keep track of my files in a certain spot and being able to name my files so I can keep track of their location better was a huge help. It allowed for easy updates and maintenance for data space.
